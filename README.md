# SparREST

#### A REST sparring to learn and test front-end technologies by making HTTP requests. 

SparREST **works as a [SimpleHTTPServer](https://docs.python.org/2/library/simplehttpserver.html)** serving your static files in the working directory, and it also works as an **API Rest that stores any data** you send to it just by using `/api/<resource>` at the begining of your URL. 

## Tutorial

Let's create a fighters database. 

### Running the server

```bash
mkdir FigthersDB
cd FigthersDB
python server.py
```

And here we go!

```bash
Starting a server on port 8000
```

### Creating a welcome page

```bash
echo "<h1>Hello World</h1>" > index.html
```

And to recover the welcome page (that is a static file):

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/
```

And we have what we want:

```html
<h1>Hello World</h1>
```

### Creating our first fighter

Making a POST to the resource that we want (fighters in this case) with the `"Content-Type: application/json"` header and the body in JSON format:

```bash
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d '{"name": "Chuck Norris", "style": "Karate"}' http://localhost:8000/api/fighters
```

And it returns a JSON object with an ID autogenerated:

```json
{  
   "style":"Karate",
   "name":"Chuck Norris",
   "id":1
}
```

This will create a `db` folder in your working directory and a `fighters` directory inside with a file called `1`.

We can also **bulk insert** a bunch of fighters by using a JSON array:

```bash
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d '[{"name": "Bruce Lee", "style": "Kung Fu"}, {"name": "Rocky Balboa", "style": "Boxing"}]' http://localhost:8000/api/fighters
```

This will two files inside our `db/fighters` folder called `2` and `3`. You got it?

```json
[  
   {  
      "style":"Kung Fu",
      "name":"Bruce Lee",
      "id":2
   },
   {  
      "style":"Boxing",
      "name":"Rocky Balboa",
      "id":3
   }
]
```

### Retrieving all fighters

Just make a GET request to `http://localhost:8000/api/fighters`:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/fighters
```

It returns a JSON list with all the fighters that we have inserted:

```json
[  
   {  
      "style":"Karate",
      "name":"Chuck Norris",
      "id":1
   },
   {  
      "style":"Kung Fu",
      "name":"Bruce Lee",
      "id":2
   },
   {  
      "style":"Boxing",
      "name":"Rocky Balboa",
      "id":3
   }
]
```

### Retrieving just one fighter

To recover a single fighter, we have to call the URL using the fighter ID `http://localhost:8000/api/fighters/<resource_id>` with the HTTP PUT method.

We're gonna take some risks, and retrieve Chuck Norris:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/fighters/1
```

It returns a JSON list with all the fighters that we have inserted:

```json
{  
   "style":"Karate",
   "name":"Chuck Norris",
   "id":1
}
```

### Updating a fighter

To update a fighter, we have to make a PUT request to the fighter URL.

To update Rocky:

```bash
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X PUT -d '{"name": "Robert Rocky Balboa", "style": "Boxing"}' http://localhost:8000/api/fighters/3
```

And it returns the fighter updated:

```json
{  
   "style":"Boxing",
   "name":"Robert Rocky Balboa",
   "id":"3"
}
```

### Deleting a fighter

To recover a fighter, we have to call the URL using the fighter ID `http://localhost:8000/api/fighters/<resource_id>` with the HTTP DELETE method:

If we delete Rocky:

```bash
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X DELETE http://localhost:8000/api/fighters/3
```

It returns just a `204 No Content` HTTP response and if we try to recover the deleted fighter:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/fighters/3
```

We have a `404 Not found` HTTP response with the content:

```json
{  
   "404":"Resource fighters/3 not found"
}
```

## Available API endpoints

### `GET /api/<resource_name>`

It looks for files in **db/\<resource_name>** folder and returns the content in JSON.

If the folder does not exist, a 404 HTTP error is returned.

### `POST /api/<resource_name>`

It creates a new item in the **db/\<resource_name>** (creating the **db/\<resource_name>** folder if it doesn't exist). 

Is mandatory to send the **Content-Type: application/json** header to the request and the body must have a **valid JSON format**.

It can receive a JSON object or a JSON array of JSON objects.

If the folder does not exist, a 404 HTTP error is returned.
If the *Content-Type: application/json* or the *JSON body is not valid* header is not set, a 400 HTTP error is returned.

### `GET /api/<resource_name>/<resource_id>`

Retrieves an object stored in the file **db/\<resource_name>/\<resource_id>**. 

If the file does not exist, a 404 HTTP error is returned.

### `PUT /api/<resource_name>/<resource_id>`

Replaces the content stored in the file **db/\<resource_name>/\<resource_id>**) by the body of the request.

If the file does not exist, a 404 HTTP error is returned.
If the *Content-Type: application/json* or the *JSON body is not valid* header is not set, a 400 HTTP error is returned.

### `DELETE /api/<resource_name>/<resource_id>`

Deletes the file **db/\<resource_name>/\<resource_id>**).

If the file does not exist, a 404 HTTP error is returned.
